# Gauge Random Data Project  
## Idea  
To have a simple and easy-usable project for creating random data for 
[http://gauge.org](http://gauge.org) based on
[https://github.com/DiUS/java-faker](https://github.com/DiUS/java-faker). 

## Defining Variables
One can define variables, that can be referenced inside gauge scenarios.

All random data is generated by the java-faker library.

Depending on the gauge project configuration, variables are stored in different scopes.

Based on the `gauge_clear_state_level` environment variable in a gauge project, the following scopes can be used

 | gauge_clear_state_level | scope |
 |-----------------------|-----|
 |suite|getSuiteDataStore|
 |spec|getSpecDataStore|
 |scenario|getScenarioDataStore|

### Available Steps

* Set a variable to a fixed value
```
* Set <variable> to <value>
```
* Create a unique value (string) of length 8. String contains numbers and characters
```
* Create a string <variable>
```
* Create a unique string of custom length (max 36 characters long). String contains numbers and characters
```
* Create a string <variable> with length
```
## Different Locale
As the faker library allows to use different locale, one can define the locale to use
in the gauge project via the environment variable `gauge.data.locale`. The available values are the locale that are
mentioned on the faker homepage.
