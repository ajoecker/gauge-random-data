# Gauge Random Data Project  
## Idea  
To have a simple and easy-usable project for creating random data for 
[http://gauge.org](http://gauge.org) based on
[https://github.com/DiUS/java-faker](https://github.com/DiUS/java-faker). 

## Defining Variables
One can define variables, that can be referenced inside gauge scenarios.

All random data is generated by the java-faker library.

Depending on the gauge project configuration, variables are stored in different scopes.

Based on the `gauge_clear_state_level` environment variable in a gauge project, the following scopes can be used

 | gauge_clear_state_level | scope |
 |-----------------------|-----|
 |suite|getSuiteDataStore|
 |spec|getSpecDataStore|
 |scenario|getScenarioDataStore|

### Available Steps

* Set a variable to a fixed value
```
* Set <variable> to <value>
```
* Create a string of length 8. String contains numbers and characters
```
* Create a string <variable>
```
* Create a string of custom length (max 36 characters long). String contains numbers and characters
```
* Create a string <variable> with length
```
* Create a string for a certain pattern/foramt
```
* Create a string as <variable> in format <format>
```
The format can be any string, for which the following replacements are applied
* `%s` - will be replaced with a lower case alphabetic character
* `%S` - will be replaced with an upper case alphabetic character
* `%d` - will be replaced with an one digit integer
* `{n}` - is a suffix to any option above, where `n` is replaced with a number and indicates the 
length of the pattern ahead.

for example: 

`abc%S%S-%d%d` will result in a string like `abcTR-24` or similar

`%d{2}%S{2}' will create a string with two digits and two uppercase characters.

## Different Locale
As the faker library allows to use different locale, one can define the locale to use
in the gauge project via the environment variable `gauge.data.locale`. The available values are the locale that are
mentioned on the faker homepage.
